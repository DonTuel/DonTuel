- 👨‍🦳 Hi, I’m Don Tuel. I worked as a programmer/technical support/software developer/software engineer for over 30 years on multiple platforms including IBM mainframes, personal computers, and servers before retiring in 2013.
- 👀 I still enjoy programming, among other pursuits.
- 💻 I’m currently working on various personal projects in Unity, Unreal engine, Windows applications using C# or Visual Basic, and occasionally mainframe programs using the Hercules emulator.
- 📫 How to reach me: dontuel@gmail.com (put GitHub in the subject or it might end up in spam or trash).
